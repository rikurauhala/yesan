# Testing

## Unit testing and integration testing

The application can be tested automatically by running the command `poetry run invoke test`. Unit testing and integration testing have been created with the `pytest` framework. Test related files are located in the src/tests directory.

Automated tests utilise the pytest library and test most of the programs functionality.

### Coverage report

Most of the source code is covered by automated tests. User interface (directory src/ui) is omitted from the test coverage as it is not tested automatically in the first place. A coverage report can be generated by running the command `poetry run invoke coverage-report`. The report files are stored in the htmlcov directory. The test coverage report can be viewed by opening the file htmlcov/index.hmtl in the web browser.

## System testing

The application has been tested manually, as it has a graphical user interface.
